# Benchmark for Core Challenge 2022

- This repository provides benchmark instances for [Core Challenge 2022](https://core-challenge.github.io/2022/).
- Benchmark instances will be released in three times according to [the schedule](https://core-challenge.github.io/2022/#schedule).

## Format of benchmark instances

- See [File Format](https://core-challenge.github.io/2022/#file-format).
- Each instance is provided by 2 files (*.col and *.dat) which are named like **foo.col** and **foo_bar.dat**.

## The 1st benchmark instances

- The 1st benchmark instances are intended to help contestants to develop their first prototype solvers.
- So, each instance is relatively small. And, this set includes the both of "YES" and "NO" instances.
- You can find those instances in the following directories.
  - benchmark/handcrafted
  - benchmark/grid
- You can also use [the full list of the 1st benchmark instances](/list/list-1st-benchmark.csv) (in CSV format).

## The 2nd benchmark instances

- The 2nd benchmark instances should be more difficult than the 1st ones. At least they are larger.
- You can find those instances in the following directories.
  - benchmark/grid
  - benchmark/queen
- You can also use [the full list of the 2nd benchmark instances](/list/list-2nd-benchmark.csv) (in CSV format).

## The 3rd benchmark instances

- The 3rd benchmark instances include various kinds of instances, and 200x200 instances for grid and queen. 
- You can find those instances in the following directories.
  - benchmark/sp
  - benchmark/square
  - benchmark/power
  - benchmark/color04
  - benchmark/grid
  - benchmark/queen
- You can also use [the full list of the 3rd benchmark instances](/list/list-3rd-benchmark.csv) (in CSV format).

## All benchmark instances

- You can also use [the full list of all benchmark instances](/list/list-all-benchmark.csv) (in CSV format).
	- This file is just the concatenation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd benchmark instances.
